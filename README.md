# Block.Ed
This repo hosts the open source code and documentation of the Block.Ed project and the Blockchain plugin. This project integrates the Moodle LMS platform with blockchain technology to issue and verify tamper-proof course completion certificates/badges using SoulBound Tokens (SBTs) and Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs). The system architecture below consists of 2 main building blocks: The Moodle platform in the left side that can interact with third party microcredential tools (e.g MICOO) and the Blockchain plugin in the right. Focusing on the Blockchain plugin, it consists of the **Blockchain network**, the **Blockchain Plugin Server** and the **Verifier Application**. In this Readme file we throughly present each element and provide open-source code for any possible adopters.

## 📌 Overview

This system enables:
- Automatic issuance of certificates upon course completion in Moodle.
- Creation of verifiable SoulBound Tokens stored on the blockchain.
- Decentralized, privacy-preserving certificate verification via mobile app.

---

## 📚 Architecture Components

### 1. **Moodle Platform**
- LMS where students complete courses.
- On course completion:
  - Certificate/badge is generated (name, email, certificate ID, etc..).
  - Data is sent to the **Blockchain Plugin Server** via REST API.

### 2. **Blockchain Plugin Server**
- Acts as an **oracle** connecting Moodle to the blockchain.
- Responsibilities:
  - ✅ Check/Create **Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)**.
  - 🔗 Generate **SoulBound Tokens (SBTs)**.
  - 🔒 Construct and store **Verifiable Certificate Hashes**.

### 3. **Blockchain Network**
- Stores certificate data in a decentralized, tamper-proof way.
- Uses:
  - 🤖 **Smart Contracts** for automation and data integrity.
  - 🧩 Distributed nodes (Node #1, Node #2, Node #3).

### 4. **Verifier Application**
- Used by employers/organizations for certificate validation.
- Supports:
  - Mobile interface.
  - QR scanning.
  - Direct blockchain verification.
- How to install the “Verifier-App” on your Android phone:
  - Download the file and save it on your phone.
  - On your phone go to Settings → Apps & notifications → Special app access → Install unknown apps.
  - Find your browser (e.g. Chrome) or file manager, and enable Allow from this source.
  - Open “Files” or “Downloads” on your phone, tap the file blocked-release.vX.0.apk, and tap Install.
  - After installation is done, tap Open to launch the app (or find it in your Apps list).
  - Once the app is working, you may disable the “Allow from this source” setting for the browser/file manager for extra safety.

## 🚀 Workflow

1. **Student completes a course** in Moodle.
2. Moodle triggers a REST API call to the Blockchain Plugin Server.
3. The server:
   - Registers/checks DIDs.
   - Issues an SBT representing the certificate.
   - Constructs a verifiable certificate hash.
4. Data is stored on the blockchain via smart contracts.
5. Third-party verifiers use a **mobile app** to validate certificates.

  - Sends certificate/user data to Blockchain Plugin Server.
  - Parses and displays the response (e.g., SBT, token hash).
- **Certificate Enrichment**:
  - Embed blockchain token or QR code into certificate.
  - Ensure format compatibility.

### 🖥️ Implementation Point #2: Blockchain Plugin Server
- **DID Handling**:
  - Secure creation/validation of student and certificate DIDs.
- **SBT Management**:
  - Link certificates to blockchain identities.
- **APIs**:
  - `Issue API`: Triggered by Moodle.
  - `Verification API`: Used by mobile app.
  - `Verifiable Hash API`: Returns verifiable DID hash.

### 📱 Implementation Point #3: Verifier Application
- **UI/UX**:
  - Simple input for certificate details or QR scan.

## 🔐 Decentralized Certificate Hashing

### 🔄 DID Structure

- **Certificate DID**:  
  `did:blocked/{ApplicationKey}/{IssueAuthority}/{CourseMoodleID}/{CertificateID}`

- **Certificate Owner DID**:  
  `did:blocked/{ApplicationKey}/{PlatformUserID}/{Lastname}/{Name}`

### 🧮 Hashing Algorithm


Hash = SHA-256(SHA-256(CertificateID + CertificateOwnerDID))

### 🔗Deploy a private Blockchain network
## Private Quorum Network with QBFT Consensus

This project sets up a private [GoQuorum](https://consensys.net/quorum/) blockchain network using the QBFT consensus algorithm. It is designed for fast development and testing of permissioned blockchain applications.

🧪 QBFT Consensus Overview
QBFT (Quorum Byzantine Fault Tolerance) is a consensus protocol designed for private networks. In QBFT networks:
docs.goquorum.consensys.io

Validators: Approved accounts known as validators validate transactions and blocks.

Block Creation: Validators take turns to create the next block.

Consensus Requirement: Before inserting a block onto the chain, a super-majority (≥ 2/3) of validators must sign the block.

Finality: Blocks in QBFT are final, meaning there are no forks, and valid blocks must be in the main chain.


It's crucial to maintain more than 2/3 of validators active to prevent the network from stalling. 


🛠️ Genesis File Configuration
The genesis.json file defines the initial state and configuration of the blockchain network. Key parameters include:

chainId: Unique identifier for your blockchain network.

qbft: Configuration specific to the QBFT consensus protocol, such as blockperiodseconds, epochlength, and requesttimeoutseconds.

alloc: Pre-funded accounts with their respective balances.

Ensure that the extraData field includes the list of validator addresses. 

🔄 Managing Validators
QBFT allows for dynamic management of validators:

Adding/Removing Validators: Existing validators can propose and vote to add or remove validators using JSON-RPC API methods.

Consensus for Changes: A majority vote (greater than 50%) is required to add or remove a validator.


## 🧩 Features

- QBFT consensus for Byzantine fault-tolerant block finality.
- Static node peering with pre-defined enode addresses.
- Configurable chain parameters and pre-funded accounts.
- Genesis and static-nodes files included.
- Suitable for use with Ansible automation or manual deployment.

## 📁 Directory Structure

├── genesis.json # Custom genesis block configuration for QBFT

├── static-nodes.json # List of enode addresses for peer discovery

└── README.md

## ⚙️ Genesis Configuration

The `genesis.json` includes:
- Chain ID: `1337`
- QBFT settings with `blockperiodseconds` set to 5
- Istanbul and London fork compatibility
- 3 pre-funded accounts for development and testing

```json
"qbft": {
  "policy": 0,
  "epoch": 30000,
  "ceil2Nby3Block": 0,
  "testQBFTBlock": 0,
  "blockperiodseconds": 5,
  "emptyblockperiodseconds": 120,
  "requesttimeoutseconds": 10
}

static-nodes.json defines peer-to-peer connections between 3 nodes:
[
  "enode://<node1>@Χ.Χ.Χ.Χ:30300",
  "enode://<node2>@Χ.Χ.Χ.Χ:30301",
  "enode://<node3>@Χ.Χ.Χ.Χ:30302"
]
```
# Install GoQuorum.

### Instructions for Blocked Oracle Server

This guide walks you through the process of deploying the `BlockCert.sol` contract and setting it up for use. Follow the steps below carefully:

#### Prerequisites
Before proceeding, ensure you have the following:

- **Node.js** (Version 18 or higher) installed.
- A **MetaMask** wallet or similar Ethereum wallet connected to the network you're using.
- **npm** (Node package manager) installed for managing dependencies.

#### 1. Deploy the Contract

There are two options for deploying the `BlockCert.sol` contract:

##### Option 1: Deploy Your Own Contract

1. Navigate to the `block-oracle-server/contracts` folder where `BlockCert.sol` is located.
2. Use a deployment tool of your choice (e.g., **Truffle**, **Hardhat**, or **Foundry**) to deploy the contract. Follow the documentation of your selected deployment tool for detailed instructions.

##### Option 2: Use the Pre-Existing Contract

If you prefer using the pre-deployed contract, please **contact us** so we can enable an address of your choice as the issuer.

#### 2. Set the Issuer Address

After deploying the contract, you need to call the `setIssuer` function to enable a specific address as the issuer. This should be done using the **deployer's address** as `msg.sender`. 

- If you used your own contract, call the `setIssuer` function using the deployer's address.
- If you're using our contract, please contact us to enable the issuer address.

#### 3. Configure the Environment

Create a `.env` file to store sensitive data such as network addresses and the oracle address. Follow the structure in the provided `.env.example` file. Update the following fields:

- **NETWORK_URL**: The URL of the network you are deploying to (e.g., Rinkeby, Mainnet).
- **ORACLE_ADDRESS**: The address of the oracle for verifying certificates.
- **CONTRACT_ADDRESS**: The address of the deployed `BlockCert` contract.

Example `.env` file:

```bash
NETWORK_URL=https://your-network-url
ORACLE_ADDRESS=0xYourOracleAddress
CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0xYourContractAddress
```

#### 4. Install Dependencies

Navigate to the project folder and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install all required packages, as specified in `package.json`.

#### 5. Run the Project

Finally, start the project using **Nodemon**:

```bash
nodemon app.js
```

This will start the application and keep it running, automatically restarting it when changes are made.

---

##### Troubleshooting

- **If you encounter issues**: Ensure that your Node.js version is greater than 18 and that all required dependencies are installed.
- **Deployment failures**: Double-check the contract deployment logs for errors and verify the addresses in your `.env` file.

---

By following these steps, your `BlockCert` contract should be successfully deployed and configured. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions!
